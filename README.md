As part of the Advanced Software Engineering course, students are given the task of writing a pet project of our choice and applying concepts of advanced software engineering to this project. As part of my submission I decided to take a concept from physics and to write a program in Python that can generate animations of a coupled system of oscillators with either fixed or open boundary conditions. Below is an example of the animations produced:
